<p>He has released the meaningless statement "We looked at the rules and laws and then we decided".</p>
<p>But he can't cite the rules or laws in question</p>
<p>And he quickly sunk to lobbing insults when people didn't accept this</p>

<h3>That doesn't even begin to cover the data irregularities</h3>
<div style='background-color:#202020;border-radius:20px;padding:10px;text-align:left;width:75%;margin:auto;'>
<ul>
<li>some serious irregularities with the numbers in the nomination data, most of note is how the EPH totals in Column 9 for four categories (Best Novel, Best Short Story, Best Fan Writer and Lodestar) exceed the number of ballots cast, which should be impossible. Several more categories, said total equals over 90% of the ballots cast, which is not impossible but highly improbable, implying almost every ballot nominated at least one of the final 15 on the longlist.</li>
<li>in many categories, there is a wide difference between the number of nominations the finalists received compared to the next ones on the ranking. For example, in Best Series, we see six finalists that all received over 800 nominationsâ€” garnering more than double, if not triple what any nominee in this category had received in the history of the award-- and then the 7th receiving 52. This sort of distribution is too unlikely to be natural, it speaks of some form of tampering.</li>
